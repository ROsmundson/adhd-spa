            <p>I'm Ryan. I was diagnosed with ADHD at 12. For 30 years I convinced myself that <b><em>I can keep up</b></em>  with normal brains <b><em>in their natural environment</b></em>. That was before starting the SE Flex program at Flatiron School. Now I'm fully convinced that, <b><em>no, no I really can't.</b></em></p>
            
            <p>"Has he really buckled down?"<b><em>YES!</b></em><br>
            "Has he really applied himself?"<b><em>YES!</b></em><br>
            "Does he really have ADHD or is he just making excuses?" <b><em>ABSOLUTELY NOT.</em></b></p>
            
            <p>You see, those with normal brains are able to take the escalator. Those with brains like mine have no choice but to take the stairs or we will get tripped up!</p>
                
            <p>Don't get me wrong. I am not a "dumb" person. I'm able to learn. I've overcome and accomplished a lot with the brain I have. I graduated with a bachelors degree. I earned an MBA. The difference is, and I've learned this by living it, having an ADHD brain means signing up for the 'finisher trophy', not for the 'win'. But hey, I sign up, I always finish, and I have the trophy to prove it.</p>

            <p>Learning something new is tough for anybody. For me, having ADHD and learning something new is like playing 'Whac-a-Mole' for the first time at Chukee Cheese.</p>

            <p><b>Game 1:</b> I hyper-focuse on a single mole hole, determined to whac it!<br><b>Game 2:</b> I try watching all five holes at once and miss every mole that pops up by 'that much'.</p>  
                
            <p><b><em>but</b></em> wait, I'm just like everybody else!<br><b><em>what</b></em> am I doing wrong?<br><b><em>why</b></em> can't I just be normal!?</p>
        
            <p>Turns out, the doctors have better words to describe both 'normal' and ADHD brains. If your brain developed like it was supposed to and hasn't given you any trouble as far as you and those around you can tell, you likely have a neurotypical brain. If you have ADHD, you have a neurodivergent brain</p>
            <p>Telling someone you have ADHD usually provokes a more guarded response, as if the person is trying to figure out if you are lying to them?
            <p>Telling someone you are neurodiverse usually evokes curiosity and gives you the opportunity to educate others.</p>
