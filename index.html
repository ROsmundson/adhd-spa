                <p>I was diagnosed with ADHD at 12 and I'm one of the many lucky adults who gets to keep it through adulthood!<br>An environment I have a really hard time in is the classroom. Be it in-person, virtual, or self-paced curriculum, things just don't click as fast as they do for others. Nothing gets my anxiety going better than a teacher announcing,<br><br> <b>"Okay. Everybody take about five minutes to read what the author wrote and then we will all discuss!"></b><br><br>"Five minutes! You expect me to be able to talk about all this after just five minutes?"<br><br><em>"Hmm, looks like everyone else is just soaking up everything on the page?"<br><br>"Quick, just look at the page and act like you're reading. Grab a couple key words and do your best to fumble through an answer if the instructor calls on you".</em><br><br>
                Most people have a good idea of some of the symptoms for ADHD: <em>losing focus or trailing off while someone is talking to you; needing to move around a lot or fidget.</em> What many don't realize, is that it is a legit mental health condition caused from <em>actually having a brain that operates differently than a neurotypical brain</em>. To make it more confusing, ADHD is not just one disorder. It carries with it a smorgasbord of unfortunate, disruptive disorders that make functioning in this <em>built for normal</em> world a real challenge.<br><br>If you haven't already, take a look at the facts I collected. <b>THANKS!</b>
