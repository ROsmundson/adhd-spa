# ADHD Facts App
This application is single page, meaning only one HTML file is used. CSS and Javascript are used for styling and DOM manipulation.

There are 5 separate event listeners used for:
- Page load notification & Navigation

Data was collected and compiled in the attached db.json file. The application was programmed so that the user has the ability to navigate from and back to the home page, the facts page, and the about me page. When the user clicks on the "Read the Facts" button, a list of 10 facts about ADHD is fetched from the attached db.json file and rendered to the facts page.

How to run it!!!
--------------------

Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
